# What is the command-line interface?

The command-line interface (sometimes also called “command prompt” or “terminal”) is a way of
interacting with the computer using only the keyboard.
Many of the programs and tools used in bioinformatics are designed to work only from command-line, so
it’s very important to get familiar with how the terminal works.

Although there are different types of terminals, all of them have an interface (called “shell”) translating
the text you type into meaningful commands that the computer can understand.

Today we’ll focus on the most commonly used shell, BASH
(developed in 1989!), which is the default one for most Linux and
MacOS systems. It can also work on Windows, but you have to
manually install it.
